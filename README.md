# What is this?
This is just my repo which is showing what I'm currently studying for Python.

# About Me
I'm currently going through a career change. My background is just based on Customer Service and IT. 
I've been in It for 2 1/2 years and I've been in Customer Service for 3+ years. 

# Why Python?
Honestly I've always been fascinated with Cyber Security and as well I've been interested in creating my own Jarvis (Iron Man reference).

# Do you have previous coding experience?
I do, I've been coding in Javascript for a year or two but it really didn't grab my attention as much as Python did. I'm really exicted on my future projects with Python.
